## Hi there 👋

Blu-H is a non-profit initiative that bridges earth observation science and real-world decision-making to support humanitarian flood early warning, situational awareness, and climate resilience.

We use this GitHub space to share high-level documentation, technical concepts, and selected open components that support transparent, collaborative, and responsible development of humanitarian technology.

## What You’ll Find Here

This repository brings together **technical, analytical, and organisational materials**
supporting Blu-H’s mission to deliver responsible, humanitarian flood intelligence.

## Content may include:

- Technical and architectural documentation  
- Analytical workflows and data concepts  
- Selected open-source components and illustrative examples  
- Governance, policy, and decision records  

Not all systems, data, or operational details are public.  
Content is shared where openness supports **transparency, accountability, reproducibility,
and trusted collaboration**, while respecting safety, ethical, and humanitarian constraints.

We welcome engagement from researchers, developers, practitioners, and partners who
share Blu-H’s mission and values.

Contributions and discussions are managed through GitHub issues and pull requests, in

**do-no-harm** ethos.
