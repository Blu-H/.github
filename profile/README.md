## Hi there 👋

Blu-H is a non-profit initiative that bridges earth observation science and real-world decision-making to support humanitarian flood early warning, situational awareness, and climate resilience.

We use this GitHub space to share high-level documentation, technical concepts, and selected open components that support transparent, collaborative, and responsible development of humanitarian technology.

### What you’ll find here
- Technical and architectural documentation  
- Analytical workflows and data concepts  
- Selected open-source components and examples  
- Information on collaboration and governance  

Not all systems or data are public. Content is shared here where openness supports transparency, reproducibility, and trusted collaboration.

### Collaboration
We welcome engagement from researchers, developers, and partners who share our mission. Contributions and discussions are managed through GitHub issues and pull requests, in line with Blu-H’s governance and ethical guidelines.
